// This program aims to represent a multiple-choice questionnaire.
// First, the program asks the professor to enter the details about
// the mcq: number of questions, number of answers per questions (assuming 
// there will be the same number of answers for each question).
//
// Then, the program asks the professor to type each question along with
// the choice of answers and the correct answer to that question.
// Finally, the program students take the questionnaire and enter their answers
// to each question.
//
// A final result will be given to students in how many questions out of the total 
// number of questions. If the student succeed in answering at least half of the
// questions, he passes the test. Otherwise the student fails. 
// A message of success or failure has to be displayed at the end of the MCQ.
//
// The student can retake the test if they want to. At the end of the program, the student
// will be asked to retake the MCQ.
