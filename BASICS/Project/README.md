 This program aims to represent a multiple-choice questionnaire.
 <br><br> First, the program asks the professor to enter the details 
 about the mcq: number of questions, number of answers per  questions (assuming 
there will be the same number of answers for each question).
<br><br>
 Then, the program asks the professor to type each question along with
 the choice of answers and the correct answer to that question.
 Finally, the program students take the questionnaire and enter their answers
 to each question.
<br><br>
 A final result will be given to students in how many questions out of the total 
 number of questions. If the student succeed in answering at least half of the
 questions, he passes the test. Otherwise the student fails. 
 A message of success or failure has to be displayed at the end of the MCQ.
<br><br>
 The student can retake the test if they want to. At the end of the program, the student
 will be asked to retake the MCQ.
