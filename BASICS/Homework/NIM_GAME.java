// This program serves as an arbitrator in a Nim Game
// Rules of the game: 
// n number of matches
// + 2 players against each other
// + each player has to remove a certain number of matches from the total: 1, 2 or 3 match(es)
// + each player cannot remove the same number of matches the other player just removed:
//          example --> player1 removes 2 matches, then player2 can only remove 1 or 3 matches
// The game stops when there are no matches
