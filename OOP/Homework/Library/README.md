#Library
This program creates a library of books.
<br>
In order to do so, we create a class for the books where we define the following instance variables:
  - Title: the title of the book
  - Author: the author of the book
  - Editor: the editor of the book
as well the following methods:
  - setTitle, setAuthor, setEditor: we define the title, the author and the editor of the book
  - getTitle, getAuthor, getEditor: we can have the information on the title, the author and the editor of the book
  
 Then, we create a class for the library where we define the following methods:
   - a collection of books stored in an ArrayList (with the add method)
   - the display of the books stored in the library
