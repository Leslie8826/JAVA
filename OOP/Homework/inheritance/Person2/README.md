This program is the continuation of program Person that you can see in another folder.
<br> In this program, we create a Person2 class that inherits the properties and methods of the Person class. In the subclass Person2, we add the place of birth and modify the write() so we can also display the place of birth (POB) with the date of birth (DOB). We end up having 2 types of people: the ones who have a DOB and a POB and the ones who only have a DOB.
