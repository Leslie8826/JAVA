# This program checks if two binary trees are identical or not in terms of size and content.
The program functions with 3 classes:
   - a TreeNode class that represents the node of the binary tree
   - a BinaryTree class that represents the binary tree and its corresponding methods
   - a main class to create the tree and compare 2 binary trees
   
<br> Thanks to the BinaryTree class, we create a method PrintInOrder that takes a node as parameter and returns an ArrayList. This methods stores the data of each node of a binary in the order given by the inorder traversal (left, root, right).
<br> Then
