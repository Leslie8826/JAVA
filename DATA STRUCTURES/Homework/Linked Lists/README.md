# Managing a store's cashiers
This program was created in a intent to help small stores in the NYC area to keep tabs on their current list of employees. In this case, we picked 'cashiers' as an example.
<br> Firstly, the program asks the manager of the store to enter their name then it asks to type the number of cashiers. Finally, the program requires the manager to enter the list of the cashiers' names.
<br> We suppose that every morning, the managers can check the list or update the list of their employees.
<br> In this exercise, we use the linked list class that already exists
